# TheSnakeGame

Welcome to the Snake Game! This is a classic implementation of the Snake game using Python's Turtle module. Control a snake as it moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer with each meal.

## Features
- Increasing difficulty: The snake grows longer as it consumes food, making the game more challenging.
- Score tracking: Keep track of your score as you consume more food and the game keeps a record of the highscore as well.
- Game over condition: The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
